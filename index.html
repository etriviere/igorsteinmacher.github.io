                     </h3>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of end user and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. This trend has been facilitated by a rapid increase in number and capacity of pervasive devices such as smart phones, tablets, smart meters, etc. It also benefited from the ease of access to computing resources allowed by cloud computing. This has created a wealth of complex distributed systems that interconnect to exchange data, share processing, access control functionalities and offer advanced cyber-physical services to end users.</p>
<p>Such systems are often designed with a predetermined deployment environment. However, post-deployment environments seldom remain unchanged and systems come in contact of each other in ways that were not necessarily envisioned a priori. As such, there is a need for any distributed system to develop means of adapting accordingly by forming mutualistic relationships with other systems, forming a more complex system of systems.</p>
<p>This JISA Thematic Series provides a forum for describing innovative contributions to the conceptual and architectural design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed systems with the aim of facilitating complex systems of systems. The series presents novel research efforts and approaches in discovering and actuating opportunistic relationships between systems of different sorts such as big data systems, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, cyber-physical systems, M2M business applications, network overlays, and multimedia delivery systems.</p>

                        <a id="submission" class="anchor" href="#submission" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
                     </h3>
                     <p>Manuscripts are submitted online as per instructions at
                        <a href="https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/submission-guidelines">https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/submission-guidelines</a>. JISA is an international Open Access journal from SpringerOpen.<p>
						
<p>Before submitting your manuscript, please ensure you have carefully read the Instructions for Authors for Journal of Internet Services and Applications. The complete manuscript should be submitted through the Journal of Internet Services and Applications submission system at <a href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/jisa">https://www.editorialmanager.com/jisa</a>. To ensure that you submit to the correct thematic series please select the appropriate section in the drop-down menu upon submission. All submissions will undergo rigorous peer review and accepted articles will be published within the journal as a collection.</p>

						<p>Submissions should seek an appropriate balance between content and length. In all cases, submissions to the special issue should not exceed 20 pages of text in length, excluding references.</p>

						<p>Submissions will also benefit from the usual advantages of open access publication:
							<ul>
						<li><strong>Rapid publication</strong>: Online submission, electronic peer review and production make the process of publishing your article simple and efficient</li>
						<li><strong>High visibility</strong> and international readership in your field: Open access publication ensures high visibility and maximum exposure for your work - anyone with online access can read your article</li>
						<li>Publishing online means <strong>extended space</strong> for figures, data and video footage.</li>
						<li>Authors <strong>retain copyright</strong>, licensing the article under a Creative Commons license: articles can be freely redistributed and reused as long as the article is correctly attributed</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

						<p>It is the wish of the JISA team that all quality articles will be published in the journal independent of the funding capacity of the authors. Thus, if the authors are unable to pay the APC, we request that they contact the lead guest editors and ask for a waiver.</p>

						<p>For editorial enquiries please contact <a href="mailto:editorial@jisajournal.com">editorial@jisajournal.com</a> </p>
