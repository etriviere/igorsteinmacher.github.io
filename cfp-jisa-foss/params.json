The FOSS\r\nmovement has a major impact on how organizations work and how\r\nindividuals create, distribute, acquire and use software. FOSS\r\ndevelopment continues to grow, and its development model serves as a\r\nfoundation for business, collaboration processes, software engineering\r\npractices, IT management. On the other hand, the movement has\r\nintroduced new challenges, especially in relation to openness and the\r\ninnovative nature of this development model.</p>\r\n<p>This JISA Thematic Series seeks innovative contributions\r\nto research\r\nand development of Free and Open Source Software Development. The goal\r\nis to establish the state of the art for knowledge in this area, and\r\ndefine a research agenda for, creating a source of reference for\r\nresearchers and practitioners. In this Thematic Series, we are seeking\r\nfor original contributions of different types, including theoretical\r\nfoundations, practical, empirical, and conceptual studies.</p>\r\n<h3>TOPICS OF INTEREST</h3>\r\n<p>In this Thematic Series, we are seeking for original\r\ncontributions\r\nof different types, including theoretical foundations, practical,\r\nempirical, and conceptual studies.

JISA is an international Open\r\nAccess journal from SpringerOpen. So far, JISA papers have had a\r\nrelatively high impact\r\n(http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=1869-0238&amp;tip=iss).\r\nIt adopts the Open Access policy, allowing free access to the papers,\r\nwhile the authors retain the copyright of their papers. Several\r\nrepositories index the journal, such as Scholar, SCOPUS, INSPEC,\r\nAcademic OneFile, DBLP, DOAJ, EI-Compendex, OCLC, SCImago, and Summon\r\nby Serial Solutions.</p>\r\n<p>There is no minimum or maximum length restriction for\r\npapers.\r\nHowever, reviewers will weigh the contribution of a paper relative to\r\nits length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly. A\r\ntypical length is around 15 pages in the Springer 2-column template\r\nformat. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution\r\nmay be rejected. Although not mandatory, authors are encouraged to\r\nrefer to related papers published recently in JISA to help build the\r\nconsistency of the journal.</p>\r\n<p>It is the wish of the JISA board that all quality papers\r\nwill be\r\npublished in the journal independent of the funding capacity of the\r\nauthors. Thus, if the authors are unable to pay the open access APC\r\ncharge, we request that they contact Prof. Igor Steinmacher so that a\r\nwaiver can be granted.</p>\r\n<h3>SUBMISSION SCHEDULE</h3>\r\n<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Paper Submission:</em>\r\nMarch 1, 2016<br>\r\n<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">First response from\r\nreviewers:</em> May\r\n15, 2016\r\n<h3>Questions?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have any questions about the suitability of your\r\nmanuscript\r\nor any other query related to this call do not hesitate to contact the\r\ntheme editors.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Submissions will also benefit from the usual\r\nadvantages of open\r\naccess publication:&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Rapid publication: Online submission, electronic\r\npeer review and production make the process of publishing your article\r\nsimple and efficient&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>High visibility and international readership in\r\nyour field: Open access publication ensures high visibility and maximum\r\nexposure for your work - anyone with online access can read your\r\narticle&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>No space constraints: Publishing online means\r\nunlimited space\r\nfor figures, extensive data and video footage&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li> Authors retain\r\ncopyright, licensing the article under a Creative Commons license:\r\narticles can be freely redistributed and reused as long as the article\r\nis correctly attributed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Guest editors:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Brian Fitzpatrick - University of Limerick - Ireland\r\n(Brian.Fitzgerald@ul.ie)</li>\r\n<li>Gregorio Robles - Universidad Rey Juan Carlos - Spain\r\n(grex@gsyc.urjc.es)</li>\r\n<li>Igor Steinmacher - Federal University of Technology -\r\nParan√° - Brazil (igorfs@utfpr.edu.br)</li>\r\n<li>Tony Wasserman - Carnegie Melon University - USA\r\n(tonyw@acm.org)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</body></html>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
