                     </h3>
                     <p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is now a
                        significant component
                        in the software industry and is recognized as an important area of
                        research within Software Engineering and related disciplines. The FOSS
                        movement has a major impact on how organizations work and how
                        individuals create, distribute, acquire and use software. FOSS
                        development continues to grow, and its development model serves as a
                        foundation for business, collaboration processes, software engineering
                        practices, IT management. On the other hand, the movement has
                        introduced new challenges, especially in relation to openness and the
                        innovative nature of this development model.
                     </p>
                     <p>This JISA Thematic Series seeks innovative contributions
                        to research
                        and development of Free and Open Source Software Development. The goal
                        is to establish the state of the art for knowledge in this area, and
                        define a research agenda for, creating a source of reference for
                        researchers and practitioners. In this Thematic Series, we are seeking
                        for original contributions of different types, including theoretical
                        foundations, practical, empirical, and conceptual studies.

                     </h3>
                     <p>Manuscripts are submitted online as per instructions at
                        http://www.jisajournal.com/manuscript. JISA is an international Open
                        Access journal from SpringerOpen. So far, JISA papers have had a
                        relatively high impact
                        (http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=1869-0238&amp;tip=iss).
                        It adopts the Open Access policy, allowing free access to the papers,
                        while the authors retain the copyright of their papers. Several
                        repositories index the journal, such as Scholar, SCOPUS, INSPEC,
                        Academic OneFile, DBLP, DOAJ, EI-Compendex, OCLC, SCImago, and Summon
                        by Serial Solutions.
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no minimum or maximum length restriction for
                        papers.
                        However, reviewers will weigh the contribution of a paper relative to
                        its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly. A
                        typical length is around 15 pages in the Springer 2-column template
                        format. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution
                        may be rejected. Although not mandatory, authors are encouraged to
                        refer to related papers published recently in JISA to help build the
                        consistency of the journal.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the wish of the JISA board that all quality papers
                        will be
                        published in the journal independent of the funding capacity of the
                        authors. Thus, if the authors are unable to pay the open access APC
                        charge, we request that they contact Prof. Igor Steinmacher so that a
                        waiver can be granted.
